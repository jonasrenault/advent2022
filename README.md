# Advent of Code 2022

Repository of my code for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Install

Create an environnment using mamba

```bash
mamba env create -n advent python=3.10
```

then install requirements

```bash
mamba activate advent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

Each day's problem is in its own directory. Each day's directory contains an `input.txt` file. 
**Warning: these are my input files, input files are different for each user so results may differ.**

The code for each day's problem is in a python script file. The script files use jupytext percent format and can be run as notebooks.
